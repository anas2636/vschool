<p><b>LANGLEY, VA—A</b> report released Tuesday by the <b>CIA's</b> Office of the Inspector General revealed that the<br> CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>
    
 <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
    <p>CIA <b>Director Porter</b> Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: </p>

 <ul>
<li>the Cold War</li>
 <li>the civil-rights movement </li>
 <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
</ul>
